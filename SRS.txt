# Web-Based Calculator Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based calculator. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations and will be user-friendly and intuitive.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Interface
1. **Number Input via Clicking**: The calculator will feature a user interface with buttons for digits 0-9, allowing users to input numbers by clicking these buttons.
2. **Clear Functionality**: A clear button ('C') will be available to reset the calculator to its initial state.

### 2.2 Operations
1. **Basic Arithmetic Functions**: The calculator will support the following basic arithmetic operations:
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (ร)
   - Division (รท)
2. **Operation Buttons**: Each arithmetic operation will have a dedicated button. Once a number is entered, the user can click an operation button to set the operation to be performed.
3. **Sequential Operation Logic**:
   - The calculator will perform only one operation at a time.
   - After inputting a number and selecting an operation, if the user inputs another number, the calculator will first perform the previously set operation.
   - The result of the first operation will then be displayed, and the calculator will accept the next operation using the result as the first operand.
   - Example: If the user inputs `3 + 2`, then presses `4`, the calculator will first compute `3 + 2 = 5`, then set `5` as the first operand for the next operation with `4`.

### 2.3 Display
1. **Input and Result Display**: The calculator will have a display area showing the entered numbers, the selected operation, and the result.
2. **Error Messages**: In cases of errors (like division by zero), the calculator will display an appropriate error message.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
1. **Speed**: Calculations must be performed promptly without noticeable delay.

### 3.2 Usability
1. **Ease of Use**: The calculator interface must be intuitive and simple to use for users of all ages.
2. **Accessibility**: The calculator should be accessible, supporting keyboard inputs for users who cannot use a mouse.

### 3.3 Compatibility
1. **Browser Compatibility**: The calculator must be compatible with all major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### 3.4 Design
1. **Responsive Design**: The calculator should have a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## 4. System Constraints
1. **Internet Dependency**: The calculator will require an active internet connection to be accessed and used.
2. **Technological Constraints**: The calculator will be developed using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and must be hosted on a web server.

## 5. Quality Assurance
1. **Testing**: The calculator must undergo thorough testing, including functional testing, usability testing, and compatibility testing.
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation, including user guides and technical manuals, must be provided.
